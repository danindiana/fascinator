The project "Fascinator" is a sophisticated, multi-component system designed for web content analysis and understanding. It integrates various technologies and methodologies across its architecture, structured into several interconnected subgraphs or modules, each serving a distinct purpose within the overall system. Below is a description of its components and workflow:

### Ingest Pipeline
- **Web Crawlers**: Utilizing Python and Scrapy, these crawlers are responsible for gathering web content. The system includes a primary crawler and a secondary crawler for comprehensive coverage.
- **Apache Tika (Java)**: This component is used for extracting metadata and structured text from the collected web content.
- **Post-Processing**: Leveraging Python, pandas, and Redis, this stage processes the extracted data for further analysis, preparing it for the subsequent stages of the pipeline.

### Topic Model
- **Topic Model Enrollment**: Implements topic modeling using Python libraries (scikit-learn, gensim) and PostgreSQL with pgvector for storage. This process identifies and categorizes the main topics within the collected content.
- **Divergence Scores**: Calculates Jensen-Shannon and Kullback-Leibler divergence scores using Python (NumPy, SciPy) and PostgreSQL with pgvector, assessing the distribution differences between documents and topics for deeper insights.

### Eviction Cache
- **Unsupervised Clustering**: Applies clustering algorithms (Python, scikit-learn) on post-processed data and stores the results in PostgreSQL, grouping similar documents together.
- **Novelty Scoring**: This Python-based component evaluates the uniqueness of new information, aiding in the identification of novel content.

### Reinforcement Learning Agent
- **Episodic Learning Loop**: Incorporates a reinforcement learning loop using Python with TensorFlow/PyTorch, where an agent interacts with the environment to improve its performance in content analysis tasks.
- **Interaction**: The agent's actions influence the ingest pipeline and topic model, creating a dynamic learning environment.

### Data Storage
- **Storage Solutions**: Utilizes ZFS for raw crawled data and Parquet for processed documents, ensuring efficient data management. PostgreSQL with pgvector is used for storing topic model outputs and cluster assignments.

### Monitoring & Feedback
- **Tools**: Implements monitoring and feedback mechanisms using Python with Prometheus/Grafana, allowing for real-time tracking of system performance and facilitating adjustments based on the insights gathered.

Overall, "Fascinator" is designed as a comprehensive system for web content analysis, employing advanced techniques in web crawling, data processing, topic modeling, machine learning, and reinforcement learning to understand and categorize web content effectively. Its modular architecture ensures flexibility, scalability, and the ability to adapt to various analysis needs.
