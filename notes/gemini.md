Key Changes:

Data Storage Subgraph: Added to show the different storage types and their locations.
Database Choices:
PostgreSQL: A robust relational database well-suited for structured data like topic models and TF-IDF scores. It can handle complex queries and scale effectively.
Redis: An in-memory data store known for its speed. Ideal for the eviction cache due to its fast key-value lookups.
File Storage:
ZFS: A file system with built-in data integrity features, making it a good choice for storing raw, unprocessed web crawled data.
Parquet: A columnar file format designed for efficient storage and retrieval of large datasets, often used in big data scenarios. This format is ideal for storing processed documents to be fed into your topic model.
Hardware Considerations:
The diagram notes that you have a 2.5TB disk for data storage. While this might be sufficient initially, consider adding more storage if your dataset grows significantly.
Your powerful CPU and GPU can accelerate data processing, but be mindful of memory usage as the dataset expands.
Additional Notes:

PostgreSQL Optimization: Consider using PostgreSQL extensions like pgvector for efficient storage and querying of vector embeddings (which are often used in topic modeling).
Scaling: PostgreSQL can be scaled vertically (by adding more resources to your existing machine) or horizontally (by distributing the data across multiple servers).
Backups: Implement a regular backup strategy for all data storage components to protect against data loss.

Key Changes:

pgvector Integration: The pgvector extension is now explicitly mentioned within the PostgreSQL components. This highlights its use for storing and querying vector embeddings efficiently.
Why pgvector is Important:

Vector Embeddings: Topic models often represent documents and topics as vector embeddings in a high-dimensional space.
Efficient Similarity Search: pgvector provides functions and indexes specifically designed for fast similarity searches in vector spaces. This is crucial for finding related documents or topics.
Performance Boost: Using pgvector can significantly improve the performance of your topic model queries compared to storing vectors in standard PostgreSQL data types.

We will use apache tika to break down pdf, html, and other file formats we get from our crawler/scrapers so we should add that component. 

We will compute jensen shannon and kullback leibler divergence scores for ingested documents using the topic models from said documents as this is more compute efficienct.

Key Changes:

Apache Tika: Added to the Ingest Pipeline for content extraction from various file formats. This step is crucial for getting the text content from crawled documents before further processing.
Divergence Score Calculations: The "TF-IDF & Divergence Scores" component is now specifically focused on Jensen-Shannon and Kullback-Leibler divergence scores. This reflects your decision to prioritize these metrics for computational efficiency.
Data Flow: The arrows now show that the divergence scores feed back into the post-processing (eviction cache) and topic model enrollment steps. This suggests that the scores are used to influence both the filtering of documents and the updating of the topic model.
Additional Considerations:

Apache Tika Integration: You'll need to implement code that uses Apache Tika to extract text from various file formats (PDFs, HTML, etc.) and pass that text on to the post-processing stage.
Divergence Score Implementation: Consider using libraries like SciPy or NumPy (if you're working with Python) to efficiently calculate the Jensen-Shannon and Kullback-Leibler divergences.
Post-Processing Logic: Implement logic in your post-processing step to use the divergence scores to determine which documents should be retained or removed from the eviction cache.

Give me some options for the post-processing logic to use said divergence scores to determine which documents should be retained or removed from the eviction cache.

Show drafts
expand_more
volume_up

Absolutely! Here are some options for your post-processing logic, along with explanations to help you choose the most suitable one for your use case:

1. Threshold-Based Eviction:

Logic: Set a threshold for either Jensen-Shannon (JS) or Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. If a document's divergence score exceeds this threshold, it's evicted from the cache.
Pros: Simple to implement and understand.
Cons: Might be too rigid. A fixed threshold might not adapt well to changes in the distribution of topics over time.
2. Percentage-Based Eviction:

Logic: Evict a fixed percentage (e.g., 10%) of the documents with the highest divergence scores.
Pros: Adapts better to changes in topic distribution than a fixed threshold.
Cons: Could be wasteful if a large number of documents have similar high scores.
3. Sliding Window:

Logic: Maintain a sliding window of recent documents. Calculate the average divergence score within this window. Evict documents whose scores are significantly higher than this average.
Pros: Dynamically adapts to recent trends in topic distribution.
Cons: More complex to implement than the previous methods.
4. Hybrid Approach:

Logic: Combine multiple approaches. For example, use a threshold for initial filtering, then apply percentage-based eviction on the remaining documents.
Pros: Can leverage the strengths of different methods.
Cons: Requires more careful tuning and can be more complex.
5. Machine Learning-Based Approach:

Logic: Train a model (e.g., a simple classifier) to predict whether a document should be evicted based on its divergence score and other features (like document length, source, etc.).
Pros: Can potentially learn more nuanced patterns in the data.
Cons: Requires labeled training data and more complex implementation.
Choosing the Right Approach:

Consider the following factors when making your decision:

Computational Resources: Some approaches (like the machine learning-based one) are more computationally expensive than others.
Data Characteristics: If your topic distribution changes frequently, a more dynamic approach like the sliding window might be better.
Desired Cache Size: The percentage-based eviction method allows you to directly control the cache size.
Feel free to ask if you'd like more details on any of these approaches or have other questions!

Give me options re: #5 machine learning based approach.

Show drafts
expand_more
volume_up

Absolutely! Here are some options for a machine learning-based approach to eviction cache management, building on the idea of using divergence scores and other features:

1. Binary Classification:

Model: Train a classifier (e.g., logistic regression, decision tree, or a simple neural network) to predict whether a document should be evicted (1) or retained (0).
Features:
Divergence Scores (JS and/or KL)
Document Length
Source (Domain, website category, etc.)
Timestamp (Recency)
Other relevant metadata (e.g., number of citations, social media shares if applicable)
Training Data: Label a set of documents as "evict" or "retain" based on your existing knowledge or heuristics.
Pros: Simple and interpretable.
Cons: Requires labeled training data.
2. Regression:

Model: Train a regression model (e.g., linear regression, random forest) to predict the "value" or "utility" of a document.
Features: Same as above.
Eviction: Evict documents with the lowest predicted values.
Pros: Can capture a more nuanced sense of document importance.
Cons: Requires defining a suitable utility function.
3. Reinforcement Learning:

Model: An agent learns a policy to decide whether to evict or retain a document based on its state (features) and the reward it receives.
Rewards: Could be based on metrics like user engagement (e.g., clicks, time spent reading), or a combination of factors like divergence and recency.
Pros: Can learn complex eviction strategies over time.
Cons: Requires careful design of the reward function and can be challenging to train.
4. Unsupervised Learning (Clustering):

Model: Use clustering algorithms (e.g., k-means) to group documents based on their features (including divergence scores).
Eviction: Evict documents from the least "important" or "relevant" clusters based on some criteria (e.g., cluster size, average divergence).
Pros: Doesn't require labeled training data.
Cons: Interpreting the meaning of clusters and deciding which to evict can be subjective.
Implementation Tips:

Feature Engineering: Carefully choose and preprocess features that are likely to be informative for predicting document relevance.
Model Selection: Experiment with different models and their hyperparameters to find the best fit for your data.
Evaluation: Use metrics like precision, recall, or F1-score to assess the model's performance in predicting which documents to evict.
Online Learning: Consider using online learning algorithms to update the model as new data arrives, allowing it to adapt to changing topic distributions.
Let me know if you'd like a deeper dive into any of these methods or have other ideas you'd like to explore!

Let's go with an Unsupervised Learning (Clustering) approach for our system.

Show drafts
expand_more
volume_up

Excellent choice! Unsupervised clustering can be a powerful and flexible way to manage your eviction cache. Here's a more detailed outline of how you could implement this approach:

1. Feature Engineering:

Divergence Scores: Both Jensen-Shannon (JS) and Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergences provide valuable information about a document's relationship to the overall topic model. Include them as key features.
Document Length: Shorter documents might be less informative or valuable, so include document length as a feature.
Recency: Newer documents might be more relevant. Use the timestamp or a time-based feature like "days since crawled."
Other Metadata: If available, include other relevant metadata like the document's source (domain, category), number of citations, social media shares, etc.
2. Clustering Algorithm:

K-means Clustering: A popular and versatile algorithm that aims to partition your documents into k distinct clusters.
Alternative: You could explore other clustering algorithms like DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) if you suspect your data doesn't have well-defined clusters.
3. Clustering Process:

Preprocessing: Standardize or normalize your features to ensure they have equal weight in the clustering process.
Determining k: Experiment with different values of k (the number of clusters) to find a good balance between cluster granularity and interpretability. You can use techniques like the elbow method or silhouette analysis to help with this decision.
Clustering: Run the k-means algorithm to assign each document to one of the k clusters.
4. Eviction Strategy:

Cluster Importance: Analyze the characteristics of each cluster (e.g., average divergence, average document length, etc.).
Eviction Criteria: Define criteria for determining which clusters are less "important" or "relevant." Some options include:
Small Clusters: Clusters with fewer documents might be less representative of your overall corpus.
High Divergence Clusters: Clusters with higher average divergence might contain documents that are less central to your main topics.
Old Clusters: Clusters with older documents might be less timely.
Eviction: Periodically evict a certain percentage of documents from the least important clusters.
5. Model Updates:

Re-clustering: As new documents arrive and the topic distribution evolves, periodically re-cluster your documents to maintain the relevance of your clusters.
Implementation Tips:

Libraries: Python's scikit-learn library provides excellent tools for clustering and feature preprocessing.
Visualization: Use dimensionality reduction techniques (e.g., PCA, t-SNE) to visualize your clusters and gain insights into their characteristics.
Let me know if you'd like help refining any specific aspect of this approach!

        J[Cluster Assignments <br/> PostgreSQL]
    end
Use code with caution.

Key Changes:

Unsupervised Clustering: A new component is added within the Eviction Cache subgraph to highlight this core step.
Data Flow: Arrows now show the flow of data from the divergence score calculation to the clustering component, and then back to post-processing and topic model enrollment. This illustrates how cluster assignments influence both the filtering of documents and the updating of the topic model.
Data Storage: Added a component for storing cluster assignments. PostgreSQL is a good choice for this as well, as it allows you to easily associate documents with their cluster labels.
How the Diagram Reflects the Clustering Approach:

Divergence Scores: Calculated as before, providing a measure of how each document relates to the overall topic distribution.
Unsupervised Clustering: These scores, along with other features (e.g., document length, recency), are used to cluster the documents. This step groups similar documents together.
Eviction Decision: The clustering results are used to determine which clusters are less important or relevant. Documents from these clusters are then targeted for eviction from the cache.
Feedback Loop: The clustering process can be repeated periodically, incorporating new documents and adapting to changes in the topic distribution.
