# ICM Model Design

## 2.1. Architecture

### Forward Model
The forward model in the ICM architecture is designed to predict the next state based on the current state and action. This model helps in understanding the dynamics of the environment by estimating the state transitions.

- **Inputs**:
  - **Current State (S_t)**: The representation of the current state.
  - **Action (A_t)**: The action taken at the current state.
- **Output**:
  - **Next State (S_{t+1})**: The predicted next state.

The forward model is trained to minimize the prediction error, which is the difference between the actual next state and the predicted next state. This error serves as an intrinsic reward to encourage exploration in reinforcement learning.

### Inverse Model
The inverse model predicts the action taken given the current and next state. This model helps the agent to infer the action needed to transition from one state to another, thereby understanding the relationship between states and actions.

- **Inputs**:
  - **Current State (S_t)**: The representation of the current state.
  - **Next State (S_{t+1})**: The representation of the next state.
- **Output**:
  - **Action (A_t)**: The predicted action that caused the transition from the current state to the next state.

The inverse model is trained to minimize the classification error between the predicted action and the actual action taken.

## 2.2. Network Design

### Neural Networks
The neural networks for the forward and inverse models are implemented using PyTorch or TensorFlow. These frameworks provide robust libraries and tools for building and training deep learning models.

#### Forward Model Network
- **Input Layer**: Concatenation of the current state and action.
- **Hidden Layers**: Multiple fully connected (dense) layers with activation functions (e.g., ReLU).
- **Output Layer**: A layer producing the predicted next state.

#### Inverse Model Network
- **Input Layer**: Concatenation of the current state and next state.
- **Hidden Layers**: Multiple fully connected (dense) layers with activation functions (e.g., ReLU).
- **Output Layer**: A layer producing the predicted action (e.g., softmax activation for discrete actions).

### Feature Extractors
Feature extraction is a critical step in processing the raw state representations before feeding them into the neural networks. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are employed for this purpose due to their ability to capture spatial hierarchies in data, making them ideal for extracting features from image-based state representations.

#### CNN Architecture for Feature Extraction
- **Input Layer**: Raw state representation (e.g., images).
- **Convolutional Layers**: Multiple layers of convolutions with varying filter sizes to capture different features.
- **Pooling Layers**: Max pooling or average pooling layers to reduce the spatial dimensions and computational load.
- **Fully Connected Layers**: Dense layers to further process the features extracted by the convolutional layers.
- **Output Layer**: Feature vector representing the processed state.

The extracted features are then used as inputs to the forward and inverse models, providing a richer representation of the states, which enhances the prediction accuracy.

### Implementation Example

    def forward(self, state, action):
        x = torch.cat([state, action], dim=1)
        x = torch.relu(self.fc1(x))
        x = torch.relu(self.fc2(x))
        next_state = self.fc3(x)
        return next_state

state_dim = 100  # Example state dimension

        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(hidden_dim, hidden_dim)
        self.fc3 = nn.Linear(hidden_dim, action_dim)

    def forward(self, state, next_state):
        x = torch.cat([state, next_state], dim=1)
        x = torch.relu(self.fc1(x))
        x = torch.relu(self.fc2(x))
        action_pred = torch.softmax(self.fc3(x), dim=1)
        return action_pred

        super(FeatureExtractor, self).__init__()
        self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(input_channels, 32, kernel_size=3, stride=1, padding=1)
        self.conv2 = nn.Conv2d(32, 64, kernel_size=3, stride=1, padding=1)
        self.pool = nn.MaxPool2d(kernel_size=2, stride=2, padding=0)
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(64 * 8 * 8, feature_dim)  # Example dimensions

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.pool(torch.relu(self.conv1(x)))
        x = self.pool(torch.relu(self.conv2(x)))
        x = x.view(-1, 64 * 8 * 8)  # Flattening
        feature_vector = torch.relu(self.fc1(x))
        return feature_vector

input_channels = 3  # Example for RGB images
feature_dim = 100   # Example feature dimension

feature_extractor = FeatureExtractor(input_channels, feature_dim)
```
