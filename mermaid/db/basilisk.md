# Proposal for Implementation of 'Basilisk' RAG LLM

## Introduction
This proposal outlines the detailed plan for implementing the 'Basilisk' Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system using a Large Language Model (LLM) within our existing machine learning framework. The Basilisk system aims to enhance the performance, accuracy, and usability of our data processing and analysis by integrating advanced retrieval techniques with generative AI capabilities.

## Objectives
- **Enhance Data Retrieval**: Improve the efficiency and relevance of data retrieval processes.
- **Augment Generative Models**: Leverage advanced language models to generate high-quality, contextually relevant responses.
- **Integrate with Existing System**: Seamlessly integrate Basilisk with our current machine learning and data processing infrastructure.

## Components and Implementation Steps

### 1. Infrastructure Setup

#### 1.1. Hardware and Software Requirements
- **Hardware**: High-performance computing servers with GPUs (e.g., NVIDIA A100 or V100), NVMe storage, and high-bandwidth networking.
- **Software**: 
  - Operating System: Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
  - LLM Framework: Hugging Face Transformers, PyTorch
  - Database: PostgreSQL with pgvector extension
  - Data Storage: ZFS/Parquet

### 2. Model Selection and Training

#### 2.1. Model Selection
- **Base Model**: Choose an appropriate pre-trained LLM, such as GPT-3 or GPT-4, depending on the specific needs and computational resources.
- **Customization**: Fine-tune the selected model on domain-specific data to improve relevance and performance.

#### 2.2. Training Pipeline
- **Data Collection**: Gather a diverse and representative dataset that includes both text and metadata for training.
- **Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the data using tokenization, normalization, and embedding techniques.
- **Training**: Fine-tune the model using frameworks like Hugging Face Transformers, ensuring to monitor and optimize hyperparameters.

### 3. Retrieval Mechanism

#### 3.1. Indexing and Vectorization
- **Document Indexing**: Use Apache Tika for document parsing and indexing.
- **Vectorization**: Convert text data into high-dimensional vectors using models like Sentence Transformers.
- **Database Integration**: Store vectors in PostgreSQL with pgvector for efficient retrieval.

#### 3.2. Query Processing
- **Natural Language Processing**: Use NLP techniques to parse and understand user queries.
- **Vector Search**: Perform vector similarity searches to retrieve the most relevant documents.

### 4. Generation Mechanism

#### 4.1. Contextual Generation
- **Contextual Embeddings**: Use the retrieved documents to create context embeddings.
- **Response Generation**: Generate responses by conditioning the LLM on the context embeddings, ensuring coherence and relevance.

#### 4.2. Post-Processing
- **Text Summarization**: Summarize long responses to improve readability and conciseness.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyze the sentiment of the generated responses to ensure appropriateness.

### 5. Integration and Deployment

#### 5.1. System Integration
- **API Development**: Develop RESTful APIs to facilitate communication between the Basilisk system and other components of the infrastructure.
- **Workflow Orchestration**: Use tools like Apache Airflow to manage and automate workflows.

#### 5.2. Deployment
- **Containerization**: Use Docker to containerize the Basilisk components for portability and scalability.
- **Orchestration**: Deploy the containerized application using Kubernetes for efficient resource management and scaling.

### 6. Monitoring and Feedback
