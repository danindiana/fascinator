2. **Speech Recognition and Processing**:
   - Use speech recognition models (e.g., Wav2Vec, DeepSpeech) to convert and analyze spoken content from multimedia files.

3. **Multimodal Learning**:
   - Develop multimodal learning models that can handle and integrate data from different types of media (text, image, audio).

4. **Federated Learning**:
   - Implement federated learning to allow models to be trained across decentralized devices, enhancing privacy and scalability.

5. **Explainable AI (XAI)**:
   - Incorporate XAI techniques to make the decision-making process of ML models transparent and interpretable for users.
