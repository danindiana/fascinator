Based on the system design overview provided, the following components need to be installed in addition to Apache Maven and Apache Tika:

1. **PostgreSQL with pgvector**: For the Topic Model Enrollment and storing Jensen-Shannon & Kullback-Leibler Divergence Scores.
2. **Redis**: For the Post-Processing Eviction Cache.
3. **ZFS**: For storing Raw Crawled Data and Processed Documents.
4. **Parquet**: For storing Processed Documents.
5. **Web Crawlers**: The specific type of web crawlers needed for your system design.

Here is a brief outline of how you might install these components on an Ubuntu 22.04 system:

### PostgreSQL with pgvector
```bash
# Install PostgreSQL
sudo apt install -y postgresql postgresql-contrib

# Install pgvector extension
# Note: pgvector might require additional steps for installation. Check the official documentation for the latest instructions.
```

### Redis
```bash
# Install Redis
sudo apt install -y redis-server
```

### ZFS
```bash
# Install ZFS
sudo apt install -y zfsutils-linux
```

### Parquet
Parquet is a columnar storage format, and typically you would use a tool like Apache Arrow or a framework like Apache Spark to work with Parquet files.
```bash
# Install Apache Arrow (example for Python)
pip install pyarrow
```

### Web Crawlers
The installation of web crawlers depends on the specific type and framework you are using (e.g., Scrapy for Python, Apache Nutch, etc.). Please specify the type of crawler if you need assistance with its installation.

### Additional Steps
- **Configuration**: Each component will require additional configuration to fit your specific use case and system design.
- **Monitoring & Feedback**: Tools and scripts for monitoring and feedback should be set up according to your requirements.

For detailed installation and configuration instructions for each component, refer to their respective official documentation.
