Why Redis for Eviction Cache:

Speed: Redis is an in-memory data store, making it incredibly fast for key-value lookups. This is crucial for efficiently retrieving and filtering documents in your eviction cache.
Data Structures: Redis supports a variety of data structures like sets and sorted sets, which can be very helpful for implementing different eviction strategies (e.g., sorted sets for ranking documents by novelty or divergence scores).
Flexibility: Redis can be easily integrated with Python (using the redis library) and PostgreSQL, making it a seamless fit into your stack.
